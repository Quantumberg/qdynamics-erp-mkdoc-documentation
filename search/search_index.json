It involves defining project objectives, breaking them into tasks, assigning responsibilities, and tracking progress using tools like Gantt charts and Kanban boards. Effective project management ensures optimal resource allocation, time tracking, issue resolution, and cost control. Integration with other business processes, such as accounting and human resources, helps streamline operations. With real-time monitoring, collaboration tools, and automated workflows, project management enhances productivity, minimizes risks, and ensures successful project completion within scope, time, and budget constraints. </p> <p>Why Use Software for Project Management?</p> <p>From the very beginning of your business, a key factor for success has been (and will continue to be) your company\u2019s project management process. As your business grows, newer people, tasks, and teams are added, making it harder to track and manage projects efficiently. While collaboration still exists, the increasing complexity can lead to wasted resources and rising overhead costs. A well-structured project management system helps streamline processes, ensuring smooth operations and better resource utilization.</p> <p>With the right tools, you can create, manage, and monitor every project from a single platform. It allows tracking of purchases and sales related to projects, helping manage budgets, deliveries, and profitability. Additionally, it can be used for managing internal projects, manufacturing jobs, or service-related tasks.</p> <p>However, the success of project management depends entirely on the people involved. Simply implementing a system isn\u2019t enough\u2014teams must actively update and follow the workflow to keep projects running smoothly.</p> <p>Breaking Down the Workflow</p> <p>Most of the following terms are commonly used in project management.

For example, a fashion design team working on a summer collection would start by defining the project, setting priorities, and assigning tasks to different team members.</p> <p>The main project is created, with details such as project name, status, type, progress, task lists, and assignments. Tasks are assigned to employees across various departments, providing them with clear objectives, deadlines, and responsibilities. Expense claims related to tasks can also be recorded. Employees track their time using timesheets, logging activities, time spent, and any billable tasks. Project costs and profitability are consistently monitored, ensuring optimal resource utilization and financial efficiency. By maintaining an organized and systematic workflow, businesses can manage projects more effectively, improve collaboration, and achieve better outcomes.</p>"},{"location":"costing/","title":"Costing &amp; Profitability","text":"<p>Every project comes with associated costs, whether in terms of resources, time, or materials.

Generally, an asset is a tangible item that is located on the company premises or is carried by an employee. In some cases, an asset could be an intangible item.</p> <p>An asset's useful life spans across multiple years and hence its economic value is spread over corresponding years from the accounting perspective. If you buy a printer for $300 and it is expected to be useful for three years, from the accounting perspective $100 is recorded as the expense for three years each instead of all the $300 in the first year. Most countries have rules for such calculations.</p> <p>In this software, the Asset record is the heart of asset management module. All the transactions related to an Asset like purchasing, depreciation, maintenance, movement, scrapping, sales will be recorded against the Asset record.</p> <p>To access the Asset list, go to: &gt; Home &gt; Assets &gt; Assets &gt; Asset</p> <p>1. Prerequisites </p> <p>Before creating and using Asset, it is advised to create the following first:</p> <ul> <li>Item with 'Is Fixed Asset' enabled.</li> <li>Asset Category</li> </ul> <p>2. How to create an Asset</p> <p>An Item representing the asset should be created. The 'Maintain Stock' should be unchecked and 'Is Fixed Asset' must be checked.</p> <p>2.1 Auto creation of assets</p> <p>You can configure to automatically create assets on submission of Purchase Receipt by enabling 'Auto Create Assets on Purchase' in Item.</p> <p>If you have enabled auto asset creation for the item representing an asset, you will have to provide the asset location while submitting the Purchase Receipt.</p> <p>A message confirming the creation of assets is displayed on submission of Purchase Receipt.</p> <p>2.2 Manual creation of assets</p> <p>If you would like to create assets manually, create an Item with 'Is Fixed Asset' enabled and leave 'Auto Create Assets on Purchase' unchecked . On submission of a Purchase Receipt/Purchase Invoice with that Item a message is shown indicating that you need to create assets manually.</p> <p>Follow below steps to create assets manually.</p> <ol> <li>Go to the Assets list, click on New.</li> <li>Enter a name for the asset.</li> <li>Select the Item Code. Item Name and Asset Category will be fetched automatically.</li> <li>Select the Asset Owner, i.e. Company, Supplier, or Customer.</li> <li>Select the Company/Supplier/Customer.</li> <li>Select the Purchase Receipt/Purchase Invoice. Purchase Date and Gross Purchase Amount will be fetched automatically.</li> <li>Select a Location. Eg: Mumbai Office. This will be fetched automatically if specified in Purchase Receipt items table</li> <li>Set Available-for-use Date. The depreciation will be calculated starting from this date.</li> <li>Save and Submit.</li> </ol> <p>Please note you need create one asset record for each asset you have bought. If you have bought five computers and have created just one Purchase Receipt with quantity set to five then you will have to create five asset records manually.</p> <p>2.3 Creating composite assets</p> <p>If, for example, you want to create a \"Computer\" asset made from multiple different items like \"Monitor\", \"Keyboard\", etc., you can create a composite WIP asset by checking the is_composite_asset checkbox. Afterwards, you can tag that asset in the WIP Composite Asset field of the Item in Purchase Receipts/Invoices, and once all the items are available, you can use the Asset Capitalization feature to capitalize the asset.</p> <p>2.4 Importing existing assets</p> <p>When you move from a legacy system to software, you will have to add details of all the assets your company has purchased previously along with depreciation details of each asset.</p> <p>For an existing asset, you can create the asset record directly by checking \"Is Existing Asset\" checkbox and provide below details.</p> <ul> <li>Gross Purchase Amount</li> <li>Purchase Date</li> <li>Available-for-use Date</li> <li>Opening Accumulated Depreciation: The accumulated depreciation amount which has already been booked for an existing asset.</li> <li>Number of Depreciations Booked: Number of depreciation entries already booked.</li> <li>Is Fully Depreciated: Mark this checkbox if the existing asset is fully depreciated</li> </ul> <p>Based on these details the schedule for depreciation of remaining amount will be created automatically.</p> <p>2.5 Additional options when creating an Asset</p> <ul> <li>Custodian: The employee who will carry the asset.</li> <li>Department: The department of the Custodian.</li> <li>Calculate Depreciation: Enable this checkbox to calculate depreciation of Assets.</li> </ul> <p>3.

In case of existing assets which are partially depreciated, mention the number of pending depreciations. For example, if you set frequency as 12 months and no. of depreciations as 3, 1 depreciation will be booked every 12 months for 3 years.</li> <li>Depreciation Method: There are four available methods for depreciation: Straight Line, Written Down Value, Double Declining Balance and Manual. You can find more details here.</li> <li>Depreciation Posting Date: The date from which booking of depreciation will be started.</li> <li>Expected Value After Useful Life: Useful Life is the time period over in which the company expects that the asset will be productive. After that period, either the asset is scrapped or sold. In case it is sold, mention the estimated value here. This value is also known as Salvage Value, Scrap Value, or Residual Value.</li> <li>Salvage Value Percentage: If you want the Expected Value After Useful Life to be calculated automatically based on a percent of the Gross Purchase Amount, mention the percent here.</li> <li>Rate of Depreciation: This will be calculated based on the amount entered in expected value after useful life.</li> <li>Finance Book: The book against which the depreciation entries should be booked. </li> <li>Depreciate based on daily pro-rata: This divides the depreciation amount by the number of days in a calendar period. For example, the depreciation amount in February is less than the depreciation amount for the months that have 31 days.</li> <li>Depreciate based on shifts: This lets you define the number of shifts the asset would run in a period in order to depreciate it accordingly. You need to first define the shift names with their shift factors in the Asset Shift Factor doctype (for example: \"half\": 0.5, \"single\": 1, \"double\": 1.5 and \"triple\": 2) and set a default. Later if you want to change the shifts of an asset for a particular period, you can do so using the Asset Shift Allocation doctype, and the remaining shifts are automatically adjusted.</li> </ol> <p>3.2 Depreciation Schedule</p> <p>On booking depreciations against this Asset, the Depreciation Schedule section will be visible. This table has columns for Finance Book, Schedule Date, Depreciation Amount, Amount Depreciated, and Journal Entry.</p> <p>3.3 Insurance Details</p> <p>If Insurance has been taken for the Asset you're recording, you can store the following Insurance details:</p> <ul> <li>Policy number</li> <li>Insurer</li> <li>Insured value</li> <li>Insurance Start Date</li> <li>Insurance End Date</li> <li>Comprehensive Insurance</li> </ul> <p>3.4 Accounting Entries</p> <p>On submission of an asset, \"Capital Work in Progress\" account will be credited and the asset account related to the asset will be debited.

This method is useful when the asset depreciates fast in the beginning and slows down later.</p> <p>Example: If the asset is worth 100,000 and its salvage value is 11,000 after 8 years, the depreciation schedule would be:</p> <p>Written Down Value</p> <p>In this method, you can set a particular rate of depreciation or let the system calculate the rate of depreciation based on the asset\u2019s purchase amount, salvage value, and useful life. The rate of depreciation is applied to the current written down value of the asset to calculate the depreciation amount for each year. This method is useful for assets that have higher depreciation in the initial years.</p> <p>Example: If the asset\u2019s purchase amount is 1,000 and the rate of depreciation is 40% over 5 years, the depreciation schedule would be:</p> <p>Manual</p> <p>In this method, a system-generated depreciation schedule is created for your convenience based on the depreciation details set.

More</p> <p>4.1 Accounting Impact </p> <p>Similar to a Sales Invoice, in a Purchase Invoice you have to enter an Expense or an Asset account for each row in your Items table. This helps to indicate if the Item is an Asset or an Expense. You can also change the Cost Center. These can also be set in the Item master. The Cost Center can be set at the Company level.</p> <p>The Purchase Invoice will affect your accounts as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a typical double entry \u201cpurchase\u201d:</li> <li> <p>Debits:</p> <ul> <li>Expense or Asset (net totals, excluding taxes)</li> <li>Taxes (/assets if VAT-type or expense again)</li> <li> <p>Credits:</p> </li> <li> <p>Supplier</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>4.2 Accounting When Is Paid is checked </p> <p>If Is Paid is checked, It will also make the following accounting entries:</p> <p>Debits:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Supplier Credits:</p> </li> <li> <p>Bank/Cash </p> </li> </ul> <p>To see entries in your Purchase Invoice after you \u201cSubmit\u201d, click on \u201cView Ledger\u201d.</p> <p>4.3 Is purchase an \u201cExpense\u201d or an \u201cAsset\u201d?</p> <p>If the Item is consumed immediately on purchase, or if it is a service, then the purchase becomes an \u201cExpense\u201d. For example, a telephone bill or travel bill is an \u201cExpense\u201d - it is already consumed.</p> <p>For inventory Items, that have a value, these purchases are not yet \u201cExpense\u201d, because they still have a value while they remain in your stock. They are \u201cAssets\u201d. If they are raw-materials (used in a process), they will become \u201cExpense\u201d the moment they are consumed in the process. If they are to be sold to a Customer, they become \u201cExpense\u201d when you ship them to the Customer.</p> <p>4.4 Deducting Taxes at Source</p> <p>In many countries, the law may require you to deduct taxes, while paying your suppliers. These taxes could be based on a standard rate. Under these type of schemes, typically if a Supplier crosses a certain threshold of payment, and if the type of product is taxable, you may have to deduct some tax (which you pay back to your government, on your Supplier\u2019s behalf).</p> <p>To do this, you will have to make a new Tax Account under \u201cTax Liabilities\u201d or similar and credit this Account by the percent you are bound to deduct for every transaction.</p> <p>4.5 Hold Payments For A Purchase Invoice </p> <p>There are two ways to put a purchase invoice on hold:</p> <ul> <li>Date Span Hold</li> <li>Explicit Hold</li> </ul> <p>Explicit Hold  Explicit hold holds the purchase invoice indefinitely. To do it, in the \"Hold Invoice\" section of the purchase invoice form, simply check the \"Hold Invoice\" checkbox. In the \"Reason For Putting On Hold\" text field, type a comment explaining why the invoice is to be put on hold.</p> <p>If you need to hold a submitted invoice, click the \"Make\" button and click \"Block Invoice\". Also, add a comment explaining why the invoice is to be put on hold in the dialog that pops up and click \"Save\".</p> <p>Date Span Hold</p> <p>Date span hold holds the purchase invoice until a specified date. To do it, in the \"Hold Invoice\" section of the purchase invoice form, check the \"Hold Invoice\" checkbox. Next, input the release date in the dialog that pops up and click \"Save\". The release date is the date that the hold on the document expires.</p> <p>After the invoice has been saved, you can change the release date by clicking on the \"Hold Invoice\" drop-down button and then \"Change Release Date\". This action will cause a dialog to appear.</p> <p>Select the new release date and click \"Save\". You should also enter a comment in the \"Reason For Putting On Hold\" field.</p> <p>Take note of the following:</p> <ul> <li>All purchases that have been placed on hold will not be included in a Payment Entry's references table</li> <li>The release date cannot be in the past.</li> <li>You can only block or unblock a purchase invoice if it is unpaid.</li> <li>You can only change the release date if the invoice is unpaid.</li> </ul> <p>4.6 Provisional accounting for expenses (only for Non-Stock Items)</p> <p>In many situations, a service is received and the expense is incurred but the Purchase Invoicing for that service is done in the subsequent month, so this expense doesn't flow into your monthly financial statements like Profit and Loss as invoicing is still pending. Provisional Accounting helps you address this problem. Below are the steps to set up provisional accounting.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Enable provisional accounting in the company master and set the default provisional account</p> </li> <li> <p>Make a Purchase Receipt for a non-stock item</p> </li> <li> <p>Accounting entries against the Purchase Receipt will be as follows</p> </li> </ol> <p>Make a Purchase Invoice against the Purchase Receipt Accounting entries against the Purchase Invoice will be posted as usual</p> <p>On posting a purchase invoice accounting entries against the purchase receipt will be reversed</p>"},{"location":"Buying/purchase_order/","title":"Purchase Order","text":"<p>A Purchase Order is a binding contract with your Supplier that you promise to buy a set of items under given conditions.</p> <p>It is similar to a Sales Order but instead of sending it to an external party, you keep it for internal records.</p> <p><code>Home &gt; Buying &gt; Purchasing &gt; Purchase Order</code></p> <p>1.

You can attach an Item Tax Template to apply a specific tax rate to the item. * Item weights will be fetched if set in the Item master else enter manually. * Warehouse: The warehouse where the items will be delivered, will be auto filled if 'Set Target Warehouse' was set in the Purchase Order.

This will help you from preventing over-supply. It will also help you to track how well your Supplier is doing on timeliness.</p> <p>Allow Zero Valuation Rate: Ticking on 'Allow Zero Valuation Rate' will allow submitting the Purchase Receipt even if the Valuation Rate of the Item is 0. This can be a sample item or due to a mutual understanding with your Supplier.</p> <p>3.5 Raw Materials Supplied</p> <p>This section appears when 'Supply Raw Materials' supplied is set to 'Yes'. This section shows a table with the Items to be supplied to the Supplier for the subcontracting process.</p> <ul> <li>Set Reserve Warehouse: When Subcontracting, the raw materials can be reserved in a separate Warehouse. On selecting the Reserved Warehouse here, it'll be fetched into Item rows of the Raw Materials Supplied table.</li> </ul> <p>Supplied Items Table </p> <ul> <li>Required Quantity: The count of Items required to complete the subcontracting as specified in the BOM.</li> <li>Supplied Quantity: This will be updated when you create Stock Entries to transfer materials to Supplier Warehouse from the Reserve Warehouse using the Transfer button. </li> </ul> <p>3.6 Purchase UOM and Stock UOM Conversion</p> <p>You can change your UOM as per your stock requirements in the Purchase Order.</p> <p>For example, if you have bought your raw material in large quantities with UOM - boxes and wish to stock them in UOM - Nos; you can do so while making your Purchase Order.</p> <ol> <li>Store UOM as Nos in the Item master. Note that the UOM in the Item master is the stock UOM.</li> <li>In the Purchase Order mention UOM as Box. (Since material arrives in Boxes)</li> <li>In the Warehouse and Reference section, the UOM will be pulled in as Nos (from the Item form):</li> <li>Mention the UOM conversion factor.

The cost will usually increase with the distance of shipping. To know more, visit the Shipping Rule page.</p> <p>For example, you buy Items worth X and sell them for 1.3X. So, your Customer pays 1.3 times the tax you pay your Supplier. Since you have already paid tax to your Supplier for X, what you owe your government is only the tax on 0.3X.</p> <p>This is very easy to track since each tax head is also an Account. Ideally you must create two Accounts for each type of VAT you pay and collect, \u201cPurchase VAT-X\u201d (asset) and \u201cSales VAT-X\u201d (liability), or something to that effect.</p> <p>3.8 Additional Discount</p> <p>Other than recording discount per item, you can add a discount to the whole purchase order in this section.

Formulas can use the following mathematical functions:</p> <ul> <li>addition: +</li> <li>subtraction: -</li> <li>multiplication: *</li> <li>division: /</li> <li>min: min(x,y)</li> <li>max: max(x,y)</li> <li>if/else: (x) if (formula) else (y)</li> <li>less than: &lt;</li> <li>greater than: &gt;</li> <li>variables: {variable_name}</li> </ul> <p>It is crucial that the formula be solvable for all variable values. This is most often an issue if the value resolves to 0. For example:</p> <p><code>{total_accepted_items} / {total_received_items}</code></p> <p>This example would resolve to 0 / 0 in periods where there are no received items, and therefore should have a check to protect in this case:</p> <p><code>({total_accepted_items} / {total_received_items}) if {total_received_items} &gt; 0 else 1.</code></p> <p>2.5 Evaluating the Supplier</p> <p>An evaluation is generated for each Supplier Scorecard Period by clicking the \"Generate Missing Scorecard Periods\" button.

To prepare a Balance Sheet, you should make the accounting entries for those assets. There are generally two different methods of accounting for inventory.</p> <p>1. Auto/Perpetual Inventory</p> <p>In this process, for each stock transaction, the system posts relevant accounting entries to sync stock balance and accounting balance. This is the default setting for new accounts. By default, Perpetual Inventory is enabled in the Company.</p> <p>When you buy and receive items, those items are booked as the company\u2019s assets (stock-in-hand). When you sell and deliver those items, an expense (Cost of Goods Sold) equal to the landed cost of the items is booked. General Ledger entries are created after every stock transaction. As a result, the value as per Stock Ledger always remains the same with the relevant account balance. This improves the accuracy of the Balance Sheet and the Profit and Loss statement.</p> <p>Read Perpetual Inventory documentation to check accounting entries for a particular stock transaction.</p> <p>1.2 Advantages of Perpetual Inventory</p> <p>Perpetual Inventory system will make it easier for you to maintain the accuracy of the company's asset and expense values. Stock balances will always be synced with relevant account balances, so no more periodic manual entry needs to be done to balance them.</p> <p>In case of new back-dated stock transactions or cancellation/amendment of an existing transaction, all the future Stock Ledger entries and GL Entries will be recalculated for all items of that transaction. The same is applicable if any cost is added to the submitted Purchase Receipt later through the Landed Cost Voucher.</p> <p><code>Note: Perpetual Inventory completely depends upon the item valuation rate. Hence, you have to be more careful entering the valuation rate while making any incoming stock transactions like Purchase Receipt, Material Receipt, or Manufacturing/Repack.</code></p> <p>2. Periodic Inventory</p> <p>In this method, accounting entries need to be created manually in order to sync stock balance and relevant account balance. The system does not create accounting entries automatically for assets at the time of material purchases or sales.</p> <p>In an accounting period, when you buy and receive items, an expense is booked in your accounting system. You sell and deliver some of these items.</p> <p>At the end of an accounting period, the total value of items to be sold, need to be booked as the company\u2019s assets, often known as stock-in-hand.</p> <p>The difference between the value of the items remaining to be sold and the previous period\u2019s stock-in-hand value can be positive or negative. If positive, this value is removed from expenses (Cost of Goods Sold) and is added to assets (stock-in-hand).

It consists of four main columns: Opening Stock, In Stock, Out Stock, and Balance Stock. The Balance Stock is calculated using the formula Opening Stock + In Stock - Out Stock.</p> <p>One of the key challenges in preparing the Stock Balance report is the calculation of the Opening Stock. To determine the Opening Stock, the system reads all the rows in the Stock Ledger Entry table that come before the specified From Date filter. However, a potential issue arises when the filter for item code or warehouse is not set, and the Stock Ledger Entry table contains a vast number of records. This situation can significantly slow down the process and cause performance problems.</p> <p>Closing Stock Balance </p> <p>To address this issue, a solution has been introduced - the \"Closing Stock Balance\" feature. This feature allows the system to prepare the Opening Stock in advance, reducing the time taken to generate the Stock Balance report.</p> <p>Here's how to use the \"Closing Stock Balance\" feature effectively:</p> <ol> <li>Closing Stock Balance Creation: After the financial year has ended, and the necessary audits have been completed for that year (in this example, the financial year 2022-2023), you should create the Closing Stock Balance. This should be done for the specific end date of the financial year 2022-2023.</li> <li>Data Preparation: Once the Closing Stock Balance is submitted, the system will take some time to prepare the data. During this process, the Opening Stock values are calculated and stored for future use.</li> <li>Utilizing Closing Stock Balance: With the Closing Stock data prepared, the system will utilize this data to generate the Stock Balance report efficiently. Now, whenever a user opens the Stock Balance Report, the system can quickly read the necessary data from the Closing Stock Balance for the Opening Stock values.</li> <li>Annual Closing Stock Balance: It is essential to create the closing stock balance every year after the closing of the financial year. This ensures that the Opening Stock values are updated and accurate for each reporting period.</li> </ol> <p>By implementing the \"Closing Stock Balance\" feature and following the recommended steps, businesses can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of generating Stock Balance reports, even with a vast amount of data in the Stock Ledger Entry table.</p>"},{"location":"Stocks/delivery_trip/","title":"Delivery Trip","text":"<p>A Delivery Trip records Customer Deliveries in one vehicle.</p> <p>Multiple stops can also be added and Submitted Delivery Note can be tagged per Customer.</p> <p>1.

Item variants let you treat the small, medium, and large versions of a t-shirt as variations of one Item 't-shirt'.</p> <p>Without Item variants, you would have to treat the small, medium and large versions of a t-shirt as three separate Items.</p> <p>1. Using Item Variants</p> <p>Variants can be based on two things:</p> <ul> <li>Item Attributes</li> <li>Manufacturers</li> </ul> <p>Tip: Once an item template is created, when you update this template, all the variants are also updated accordingly.</p> <p>1.1 Creating the Item Variant Template</p> <p>To use Item Variants, create an Item and tick 'Has Variants' under Variants.</p> <p>The Item then shall be referred to as a so-called 'Template'. Such a Template is not identical to a regular 'Item' any longer. For example, it (the Template) cannot be used directly in any transaction (Sales Order, Delivery Note, Purchase Invoice) itself.</p> <p>Only the Variants of the Item (blue t-shirt in size small) can be practically used. Therefore it would be ideal to decide whether an item 'Has Variants' or not directly when creating it. Has Variants</p> <p>On selecting 'Has Variants' a table will appear. Specify the variant attributes for the Item in the table. In case the attribute has Numeric Values, you can specify the range and create intervals based on the increment values. Valid Attributes</p> <p>Note: You cannot make Transactions against a 'Template'.</p> <p>1.2 Creating the Item Variants Based on Item Attributes</p> <p>To create 'Item Variants' against a 'Template' click on 'Create'. From there, choose whether to create a single variant or multiple. Single is simple where you create just one or more attributes and one Item will be created. When choosing multiple variants, tick the attributes and multiple items will be created. For example, if you choose Color: Red, Green and Size: Small, Medium, Large, 6 variants will be created.</p> <p>1.3 Item Variants Based on Manufacturers</p> <p>To setup variants based on Manufacturers, in your Item template, set \"Variants Based On\" as \"Manufacturers\" In this case, to create variants, click on Create &gt; Make Variant. The system will prompt you to select a Manufacturer. You can also optionally put in a Manufacturer Part Number.</p> <p>The naming of the variant will be based on the name (ID) of the template Item with a number suffix. e.g. \"Screwdriver\" will have variant \"Screwdriver-1\".</p> <p>2.

When only 10 Motherboards are remaining in stock, the system will either automatically create a Material Request in your account.</li> <li>Re-order Qty: The number of units to be reordered so that the sum of ordering cost and holding cost is at its minimum. The re-order quantity is based on the 'Minimum Order Qty' specified by the supplier and many other factors.</li> </ul> <p>For example, If reorder level is 100 items, your reorder quantity may not necessarily be 100 items. The Reorder quantity can be greater than or equal to the reorder level. It may depend upon lead time, discount, transportation and average daily consumption. * Material Request Type: The Material Request type with which the stock will be reordered. This depends whether you buy the Item, manufacture it yourself or transfer it between Warehouses.</p> <p>Note: The Material Request is created at 12 midnight depending on the set reorder level.</p> <p>3.5 Multiple Units of Measure</p> <p>You can add alternate UoMs for an Item. If the default UoM in which you sell is numbers (NoS) but you receive it in Kilos, you can set an additional UoM with an appropriate conversion factor.

You need to purchase a new washing machine for your home. Before making an actual purchase, you probably do some research to know the best price. In this process, you often found a better deal from a store which is long away from your home. But you should also consider shipping cost while buying from that store. Total cost including shipping might be more than the price you get in your nearby store. In that case, you will choose to buy from your nearest store, as the landed cost of the item is cheaper in the nearest store.</code></p> <p>Similarly in business, identifying landed cost for an Item/product is very crucial, as it helps to decide selling cost of that item and impacts the company\u2019s profitability. Hence all applicable landed cost charges should be included in Item\u2019s valuation rate.</p> <p>According to the Third-Party Logistics Study, only 45% of the respondents stated that they use Landed Cost extensively. The main reasons of not using Landed Cost were unavailability of necessary data (49%), lack of right tools (48%), insufficient time (31%), and not sure how to apply landed cost (27%).</p> <p>To access the Landed Cost Voucher list, go to: &gt; Home &gt; Stock &gt; Tools &gt; Landed Cost Voucher</p> <p>1. Prerequisites</p> <p>Before creating and using Landed Cost Voucher, it is advised that you create the following first:</p> <ul> <li>A Purchase Receipt or Purchase Invoice with Update Stock enabled. This is your original receipt of goods.</li> <li>A Purchase Invoice for the landed costs (e.g. Freight, Insurance, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>We will then use the Landed Cost Voucher to decrease the costs recorded through the second Purchase Invoice and increase the stock value.</p> <p>2. How to create a Landed Cost Voucher</p> <ol> <li>Go to the Landed Cost Voucher list, click on New.</li> <li>Select Receipt Document Type whether Purchase Invoice or Receipt. You can select multiple documents.</li> <li>Select the specific Invoice or Receipt. The supplier name and Grand Total will be fetched automatically.</li> <li>Click on the Get Items from Purchase Receipts button to fetch the item details from the Purchase Invoice/Receipt.</li> <li>Select whether Distribute Charges Based On should be on quantity or Amount.</li> <li>Enter the Expense Account and the Amount for Additional Costs in the Taxes and Charges table. The amount will be distributed equally based on the quantity or amount as per your selection.</li> <li>Save and Submit.</li> </ol> <p>In the document, you can select multiple Purchase Receipts/Invoices and fetch all items from those Purchase Receipts. Then you should add applicable charges in \u201cTaxes and Charges\u201d table. You can easily delete an item if the added charges do not apply to that item.</p> <p>The added charges are proportionately distributed among all the items based their amount or quantity. If you selected based on the amount, the Item with the highest amount will be allocated the highest proportion of the charges. In case of quantity, Item with the highest quantity will be allocated most of the charges and the other Items will be allocated lesser amounts. </p> <p>3. Related Actions</p> <p>3.1 Adding Landed Cost in the Purchase Receipt itself </p> <p>You can add landed cost-related charges in \u201cTaxes and Charges\u201d table while creating Purchase Receipt (PR). You should add those charges for \u201cTotal and Valuation\u201d or \u201cValuation\u201d in the 'Consider Tax or Charge for' field. Charges which are payable to the same Supplier from whom you are buying the items should be tagged as \u201cTotal and Valuation\u201d. Otherwise, if applicable charges are payable to a 3rd party, it should be tagged as \u201cValuation\u201d. On submission of Purchase Receipt, the system will calculate the landed cost of all items, considering those charges. This landed cost will be considered to calculate the item\u2019s Valuation Rate (based on FIFO / Moving Average method).</p> <p>But in reality, while making Purchase Receipt we might not know all the charges which are applicable for landed cost. Your transporter can send the invoice after 1 month, but there is no point in waiting for booking Purchase Receipt till then. Companies that import their products/parts, pay a huge amount as Customs Duty. And generally, they get invoices from the Customs Department after a while. In these cases, \u201cLanded Cost Voucher\u201d becomes handy, as it allows you to add those additional charges on a later date, and to update landed cost of purchased items.</p> <p>3.2 What happens on submission?  1. Valuation Rate of items is recalculated based on new landed cost. 2. If you are using \u201cPerpetual Inventory\u201d, the system will post general ledger entries to correct Stock-in-Hand balance. It will debit (increase) corresponding \u201cwarehouse account\u201d and credit (decrease) Expense Account mentioned in Taxes and Charges table. If items are already delivered, the Cost-of-Goods-Sold (CoGS) value has been booked as per the old valuation rate. Hence, general ledger entries are reposted for all future outgoing entries of associated items, to correct CoGS value.</p>"},{"location":"Stocks/letterhead/","title":"Letter Head","text":"<p>A Letter Head contains your organization's name, logo, address, etc which appears at the top portion in documents.</p> <p>Every company has a default Letter Head.

Scan Mode, and Prompt Qty.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Scan Mode: Scan Mode Pick List feature is designed to streamline and verify the item-picking process in a warehouse or store environment. When using Scan Mode, users can scan barcodes on items to confirm that they are picking the correct products according to the Picklist. This mode is particularly useful for ensuring accuracy and efficiency during the picking process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prompt Qty: When enabled, instead of incrementing the scanned items qty by 1, a dialog will prompt the user to enter a qty to increment by.</p> </li> </ul> <p>4. Pick Manually </p> <p>In the pick list, if a user manually selects batches, the system overrides the changes upon saving the pick list. To solve this issue added a checkbox 'Pick Manually' in the pick list. If this checkbox is enabled, the system will not override the user's changes in the pick list.</p>"},{"location":"Stocks/price_lists/","title":"Price Lists","text":"<p>A Price List is a collection of Item Prices either Selling, Buying, or both.</p> <p>It lets you maintain multiple Selling and Buying Item Prices using Price Lists.</p> <p>Price Lists can be used in scenarios where you have different prices for different zones (based on the shipping costs), for different currencies, etc. An Item can have multiple prices based on customer, currency, region, shipping cost, etc, which can be stored as different rate plans.</p> <p>Here, all the Item Prices are stored separately.

For example, if you select Apply On 'Item Group' and select 'Raw Materials' in the table, this Pricing Rule will be applied only on Items that belong to the Group 'Raw Materials'.</p> <p>UoM: The Pricing Rule will apply only if the UoM set here matches with the transaction.</p> <p>Condition  In this field you can add a condition in python to check against field values in the transaction doctype, like shown below for Sales Invoice:</p> <p><code>customer=='Customer Name' and status!='Overdue'</code></p> <p>Please note that only single line python conditions will work, using fieldnames of the target doctype.</p> <p>Mixed Conditions </p> <p>If you select two or more Items and set the Min and Max Quantity. The Pricing Rule will be applied only if the total sum of Items matches the set quantities. For example, you create a Pricing Rule on Item 1 and Item 2 and set the Min and Max Quantity as 30, the Pricing Rule will apply only if the total quantity is 30.</p> <p>Is Cumulative</p> <p>Enabling this options allows the Pricing Rule to be applied cumulatively. You need to set the 'Min Amt' and 'Max Amt' for this.</p> <p>Consider a scenario where the Min Amt is 1,500 and Max Amt is 2,000. Now, if one transaction is created for 1,400 then Pricing Rule will not be applied. However, on creating a second invoice of amount 600, Pricing Rule will be applied. This happened since the total (cumulative) amount of the invoices added up to 2,000. Note that the discount will be applied only to the latest transaction that crosses the cumulative limit.</p> <p>This can be useful to give discounts if a Customer buys an Item multiple times and you want to reward him with discounts/special prices.</p> <p>3. Features</p> <p>3.1 Apply Rule On Other  This feature checks condition on first Item but applies rule on another Item.</p> <p>For example, set Item1 and Item2 in the 'Apply Rule On' table and set 'Apply Rule On Other' on Item3. Now, if the transaction has Item1, Item2, and Item3, the Pricing Rule will apply on Item3 since the first two Items were present in the transaction.</p> <p>3.2 Party Information</p> <p>Set whether the Pricing Rule is for Selling of Buying the Item.</p> <p>Based on your selection you can set applicability to one of the following masters.</p> <ul> <li>Customer</li> <li>Customer Group</li> <li>Territory</li> <li>Sales Partner</li> <li>Campaign</li> <li>Supplier</li> <li>Supplier Group</li> </ul> <p>3.3 Quantity and Amount</p> <p>Specify minimum qty, maximum qty, minimum amount, or maximum amount of an Item when this Pricing Rule should be applied.</p> <p>Note that if the quantity or amount falls short or exceeds the limits set here, the Pricing Rule will not be applied at all. However, it will be applied if you have enabled the options Mixed Conditions or Cumulative.</p> <p>3.4 Validity</p> <p>You can also set a date interval for when the Pricing Rule will be valid. This is useful for a sales promotion. On leaving the dates blank the Pricing Rule will not have any time frame limit.</p> <p>3.5 Margin</p> <ul> <li> <p>Margin Type: When selling an Item, you may sell it for a certain margin. If you don't want to add selling prices to Items every time and would like to automatically set a margin, it can be done with this feature.</p> </li> <li> <p>Margin Rate or Amount: The margin set can be based on Percentage or Amount, eg: 5% margin or $50 fixed margin.</p> </li> </ul> <p>3.6 Price Discount Scheme</p> <p>The actual rule to be applied is set in this section.</p> <ul> <li>Rate: This will be the new rate for an Item. For example, if you sell an Item for 100 and want to sell it for 112 for a specific party, then select Rate and set the Rate as 112.</li> <li>Discount Percentage: A specific discount percentage can be set. The discount percentage can be set to a specific Price List. Leaving the 'For Price List' blank will apply the Pricing Rule to all Price Lists.</li> <li>Discount Amount: A fixed discount amount will be applied. For example if you sell an Item for 100 and want to sell it with a discount of 7, then this condition can be set using the Discount Amount option.</li> </ul> <p>3.7 Advanced Settings</p> <ul> <li> <p>Threshold for Suggestion: This is the threshold based on which the system will notify you to adjust Item Quantity for discount. For example, if the Min Quantity is 10 and the Threshold is 9, the system will notify to add 1 more Item for the discount to be applicable. This also applies to the amount set.</p> </li> <li> <p>Priority: Consider an Item Group, you want to set specific rules on one Item from the group. This can be done by creating a new Pricing Rule and setting a higher priority. This can also apply to Customer Group and Supplier Group.</p> </li> <li> <p>Apply Multiple Pricing Rules: To understand this, consider an Item of Rate 500. There are two Pricing Rules on it P1 and P2. P1 applies 10% discount and P2 applies 5%. Enabling this option will apply a total of 15% on the Item Rate which gives 425.</p> </li> <li> <p>Apply Discount on Rate: The discount will be compounded. Consider the same scenario as above. On enabling this option, 10% will be applied on 500 which will give 450, then 5% will be applied on 450 which will give 427.5.</p> </li> <li> <p>Validate Applied Rule: Shows the entered validation message if the discount/rate set manually by you in a transaction does not match the Pricing Rule.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This is useful when the top distributor in the hierarchy decides the discount/rate to be applied and you are only validating if the Pricing Rule is applied correctly.</p> <p>4. Pricing Rule Discount Types</p> <p>4.1 Price Discount</p> <ol> <li> <p>Under the Margin Type, you can set whether the margin is calculated as a percentage or an amount. Eg: 10% margin on supplier price list at the time of sales.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rate mentioned in Pricing Rule will be given priority over Item's Price List (Item Price) rate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Discount Percentage can be applied for a specific Price List (Selling or Buying). To apply it for both, leave the 'For Price List' field blank.</p> </li> <li> <p>Discount can also be set in terms of amount.</p> </li> </ol> <p>4.2 Product Discount</p> <ol> <li> <p>\"Buy 2 quantities get 1 free quantity of the same item.\" To configure such type of rules, set the Price or Product Discount as 'Product discount', tick the Same Item checkbox, and set the quantity.</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Buy 2 quantities get 1 free quantity of the another item.\" To configure such type of rules. Set the Price or Product Discount as Product discount, untick the 'Same Item' checkbox and set the 'Free Item' and quantity.</p> </li> </ol> <p>New Feature - Don't Enforce Free Item Qty</p> <p>By default, it enforces the Product Discount rules without any exceptions. Imagine a scenario where a Pricing Rule is set which says that for one item, five quantity of another item will be given for free. However, it is possible that you may only have 3 quantity of that item in stock instead of 5. With this default behaviour when you try to edit the quantity or remove the free item and try to save the document, the free item will be refetched again in the child table rendering you effectively unable to submit that document as an error citing insufficent stock will be thrown.</p> <p>Since free items are usually at discretion of the seller, a new option called \"Don't Enforce Free Item Qty\" has been introduced for Pricing Rule. When you have this option enabled, it will fetch the free items only for the first time the item is added. You will then be free to edit the quantity of the free item or remove it entirely. The free item will no longer be fetched again when you save the document.</p>"},{"location":"Stocks/print_heading/","title":"Print Headings","text":"<p>Print Headings are the names/titles you can give your transactions.</p> <p>These transactions include Sales Invoices, Supplier Quotations, etc. You can create a list of names for different business communications.</p> <p>If you want to rename a transaction on how it appears when printing, you can do so via Print Headings.

If two rules have the same priority, the rule with more free space available will be assigned.</li> <li>If you are running at full capacity (no free space in any Warehouse), it will let you know.</li> </ol> <p>4. How it works</p> <p>As mentioned before, the Putaway Rules are applied on Purchase Receipts and Stock Entries (Material Receipt &amp; Material Transfer).</p> <p>A checkbox called Apply Putaway Rule will allocate items to Warehouses based on the Putaway Rules. Apply Putaway Rule checkbox</p> <p>Putaway Rules are applied on checking this checkbox. They are also re-applied on save if this checkbox is enabled.</p> <p>Let us see the same in action:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Here is a Purchase Order with a requirement of 5 Cartons (60 Nos) of Mineral Water. Purchase Order</p> </li> <li> <p>Two active Putaway Rules have been created below with capacity 4 Cartons (48 Nos) each. One has a higher priority than the other. Active Putaway Rules List</p> </li> <li> <p>A Purchase Receipt is created from this Purchase Order.</p> </li> <li> <p>On checking Apply Putaway Rule, one row of 5 Cartons is split and assigned according to the rules. Putaway Rules applied in a Purchase Receipt</p> </li> <li> <p>First, 4 out of 5 Cartons are accommodated in the 'Finished Goods - UPI' Warehouse. Once this Warehouse is at capacity, it assigns the rest (1 Carton) to the 'Stores - UPI' Warehouse.</p> </li> </ol> <p>5. Warehouse Capacity Summary</p> <p>The Warehouse Capacity Summary Report shows Warehouse capacities and their respective stock levels.</p> <p>Only Warehouses having Putaway Rules will be listed here. The Edit Capacity button gives provision to edit the Putaway Rule capacity.</p> <p>6. Types of Putaway Application</p> <p>6.1. Direct Putaway</p> <ol> <li>The example in the previous section explains Direct Putaway.</li> <li>It is, essentially, directly assigning incoming stock to certain Warehouses based on a strategy.</li> <li>This can easily be exercised via a Purchase Receipt.</li> </ol> <p>6.2. Indirect (Combined) Putaway</p> <ol> <li>Stock is often received into temporary or staging Warehouses first.</li> <li>From here it is placed into appropriate locations within the Warehouse.</li> <li>This is called Indirect or Combined Putaway.</li> <li>To simulate this within, a simple Purchase Receipt can be created into the temporary Warehouse, without Putaway applied.</li> <li>From here, a Stock Entry (Material Transfer) can be done, where Putaway Rules can be applied similar to Purchase Receipts.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Stocks/quality_inspection/","title":"Quality Inspection","text":"<p>Here you can mark your incoming or outgoing products for Quality Inspection.</p> <p>To access this feature go to:</p> <p><code>Home &gt; Stock &gt; Tools &gt; Quality Inspection</code></p> <p>1. Prerequisites</p> <p>Before creating and using a Quality Inspection, it is advised that you do the following first:</p> <ul> <li>Create an Item.</li> <li> <p>Enable Quality Inspection Criteria in the Item master. On enabling either checkboxes, submission of a stock delivery/receipt document will be allowed only after a Quality Inspection is done against it: </p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Create a Quality Inspection Template.

How to create a new Quality Inspection</p> <ol> <li>From a Draft Purchase/Subcontracting Receipt or Delivery Note, go to the Item table's Quality Inspection field and click on Create a New Quality Inspection. You can also create a Quality Inspection for Job Card in order to monitor the quality of in-process items. In this case, you can create a Quality Inspection for the Production Item in Job Card.</li> <li>Select the inspection type whether Incoming (Purchase), Outgoing (Sales), or In Process (Manufacturing).</li> <li>Select the Reference Document Type whether Purchase Receipt, Purchase Invoice, Delivery Note, Sales Invoice, Stock Entry, or Job Card.</li> <li>Select the Item and set the sample size which will be inspected.

Set the Status. Submit.</li> </ol> <p>3. Features </p> <p>A single Quality Inspection consists of many Quality Checks (Parameters) within it. Each of these checks could be Numeric, Non-numeric or Formula Based.</p> <p>3.1 Numeric Quality Checks</p> <p>Numeric Quality Checks include all checks that require number-based readings and acceptance criteria.</p> <p>E.g. checking if a reading is in a certain range.</p> <p>By default the checks are numeric. There are two fields: Minimum Value and Maximum Value, to define a range that each reading must be in. These fields can be set in the Quality Inspection Template once and be simply fetched into the Quality Inspection.</p> <p>If any of the readings entered are not within this range, the status on the row will be set to 'Rejected' automatically on Save.</p> <p>3.2 Non-numeric (Value-Based) Quality Checks</p> <p>Non-numeric Quality Checks include checks that require alphabetical values or those that do not require any mathematical calculations.</p> <p>E.g. checking if the color is white in a color quality check, Yes/No values for certain parameters, etc.</p> <p>For Non-numeric checks, enable the 'Non-numeric' checkbox. You will notice the field Acceptance Criteria Value and the section Value-Based Inspection are visible.</p> <p>Enter the field Reading Value. The Acceptance Criteria Value can be set in the Quality Inspection Template once and then be fetched into the Quality Inspection.</p> <p>If the Reading Value does not match the Acceptance Criteria Value, the status on the row will be set to 'Rejected' automatically on Save.</p> <p>3.3 Formula-Based Quality Checks</p> <p>Formula-Based Quality Checks are useful for more complex scenarios where just specifying a range or an acceptance value is not enough.</p> <p>E.g. checking if the grade of a material is A/B/C, checking if the mean of some readings is within a certain range, etc.</p> <p>Formula-Based Quality Checks are applicable to Numeric and Non-numeric Quality Checks.</p> <p>Enable the 'Formula Based Criteria' checkbox to perform a Formula-Based Quality Check. You will then notice a field called Acceptance Criteria Formula where you can specify a formula that determines whether a certain check is Accepted or Rejected. This formula can be set in the Quality Inspection Template once and then be fetched into the Quality Inspection.</p> <p>This formula depends on the many Reading fields in the Readings table.</p> <p>For Numeric readings, reading_1, reading_2 and so on are accepted in the formula.</p> <p>For Non-numeric readings, only reading_value is accepted in the formula.</p> <p>Here are some examples of formulas:</p> <p>```# Numeric (reading_1 + reading_2) &lt; 10 # sum of both readings is less than 10 (reading_1 + reading_2) &lt;= 10 # sum of both readings is less than or equal to 10 mean &lt; 15  # mean of non empty numeric readings is less than 15 (reading_1 * 2) &lt; 20 # Reading 1 multiplied by 2 is less than 20 (reading_1) / 2 &lt; 20 # Reading 1 divided by 2 is less than 20</p>"},{"location":"Stocks/quality_inspection/#non-numeric","title":"Non-numeric","text":"<p>reading_value in (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\") # Reading Value is either A / B / C reading_value != \"Red\" # Reading Value is not equal to Red ```</p> <p>Update the readings and Save. The Status field in the Readings table rows is set automatically based on the formula for acceptance.</p> <p>3.3 Manual Inspection</p> <p>So far, all the Quality Checks have automatic acceptance/rejection on Save. In the real world, there could be cases where a check is rejected but yet will be accepted because there is some tolerance.</p> <p>Such cases will require the user to determine the row-level status. To avoid any system interference in such checks, enable the 'Manual Inspection' checkbox. You can now set the status manually and it will be untouched on Save.</p> <p>Here Reading 1 is outside the defined range, this check would be rejected. But, since it is not very far from 0.153 we accept it manually.</p> <p>The status for the entire Quality Inspection can then be decided by the user.</p>"},{"location":"Stocks/rules/","title":"Rules","text":"<p>Shipping and pricing rules are essential features in stock module that streamline the management of shipping costs and pricing strategies.</p> <p>Shipping rules allow businesses to define various parameters for calculating shipping charges, such as weight, volume, destination, or shipping method.

Many users make negative stock entries in the system. For example, they create delivery notes without stock in the system by enabling the 'allow negative stock' in Stock Settings. They do this because they have to dispatch materials to their customers with the delivery receipt. To fix the negative stock, they then make a purchase receipt entry or a material receipt stock entry. Most users make the purchase entry after the delivery note date, which causes the stock adjustment entry. To understand the case take a below example</p> <p>Suppose there is an item 'Testing Item Stock Adj' for which stock doesn't exist. Now, the user has created the delivery note, but while making the delivery note, the user received an error that the valuation rate is mandatory. So, the user has set the random value as 100 in the valuation rate field for the item 'Testing Item Stock Adj'.</p> <p>Delivery Note</p> <p>Since the stock was not exists, system has used the valuation rate as 100 and booked the stock in hand as below</p> <p>Now, since the stock is in negative, we need to make a purchase entry to adjust it. So, we'll create a purchase receipt entry with a purchase rate of 300.</p> <p>Now the purchase receipt entry is created, but it is made after the delivery note (check the posting date and posting time of both entries). The delivery note has a valuation rate of 100, and the purchase receipt should have a valuation rate of 300 (based on the purchase cost). Since the stock was negative, the system uses the valuation rate of 100 (based on previous entry which was delivery note) for the purchase receipt entry. If the system used a valuation rate of 300, then the stock balance quantity would be zero, but the stock balance value would be 200, which is incorrect. Therefore, the system used a valuation rate of 100, and the difference of 200 is booked in the stock expense account (Stock Adjustment/COGS) as follows:.</p> <p>How to Solve the Problem  Either don't use the negative stock feature or make the purchase entry (backdated) before the dispatch entry, so the system will fix the valuation rate of the delivery note and no adjustment entry will be needed for the purchase receipt.</p> <p>On submission of the above back-dated purchase entry, the system will create a reposting entry that will fix the valuation rate of the delivery note.

Reconciliation items table will will keep getting updated as you scan items. Following video demonstrates this process.</li> </ol> <p>4. How Stock Reconciliation Works  Once a stock reconciliation is posted to update the quantity on specific date and time for an item in a warehouse, it will not be modified by subsequent stock transactions even if such transactions have a posting date which is prior to the stock reconciliation date. In other words, backdated entries will not change the stock numbers after a Stock Reconciliation entry is posted.</p> <p>Examples are as follows.</p> <p>4.1 For non-serialized Items</p> <p>Consider an item with code 'ABC001' in a 'Mumbai' warehouse. Let's assume that stock as on 10th January is 100 units. Stock Reconciliation is made on 12th January to set stock balance to 150 units.</p> <p>Stock Ledger would look as shown below:</p> <p>| Posting Date | Qty | Balance Qty | Voucher Type | | 10/01/2014 | 100 | 100  | Purchase Receipt | | 12/01/2014 | 150 | 150 | Stock Reconciliation |</p> <p>If a new Purchase Receipt entry is made on 5th January 2014, which is prior to the date of Stock Reconciliation entry, Stock Ledger would look as shown below.</p> <p><code>&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\"&gt;</code></p> <p>Posting Date Qty Balance Qty Voucher Type 05/01/2014 20 20 Purchase Receipt 10/01/2014 100 120 Purchase Receipt 12/01/2014 150 Stock Reconciliation</p> <p>As you can see, the Balance Qty as on 10th January got updated from 100 to 120. But the Balance Qty as on 12th January did not get updated from 150 to 170. ### 4.2 For Serialized Items For an Item, ITEM-00225 that has has the 6 serial nos HJF00020, HJF00021, HJF00022, HJF00023, HJF00024, HJF00025 with valuation rate as 530 per serial no. At the end of the year, the user has come to know that they have only 3 Serial Nos against that item with Valuation Rate 620. So to remove the old serial nos HJF00020, HJF00021, HJF00022, HJF00023, HJF00024, HJF00025 and add the new serial nos with new Valuation Rate, Stock Reconciliation can be used as follows: Select the item ITEM-00225 in the stock reconciliation, on the selection of the Item the system will auto pull the existing serials nos. Then set Qty as 3, Valuation Rate as 530 and serial no as HJF00026, HJF00027, HJF00028.</p> <p>Before reconciliation, the valuation rate was 530 and the available qty was 6, so the total stock value was 3,180. After reconciliation, the valuation rate has changed to 620 and available qty changed to 3, so the new stock value becomes 1,860. To adjust the stock value in the accounting, the system has credited extra amount 3,180 - 1,860 = 1,320 to Warehouse's account and debited to stock adjustment account.

Using the stock reconciliation, the user will be able to consume 9 batches automatically and retain one batch.

They mostly have loading docks to load and unload goods from trucks.</p> <p>The terminology of 'Warehouse' is a bit broader though and maybe can be regarded as \"storage locations\". You can create a sub-Warehouse which could be a shelf inside your actual location.</p> <p>This can become quite a detailed Tree like the following:</p> <p>Warehouse &gt; Room &gt; Row &gt; Shelf &gt; Bin</p> <p>To access the Warehouse list, go to:</p> <p><code>Home &gt; Stock &gt; Settings &gt; Warehouse</code></p> <p>1.

Setting this account will show transactions from this Warehouse in the Accounting Ledger.  Warehouse Type: You can create a Warehouse Type to classify Warehouses. For example, Supplier Warehouses, Stock Warehouses, WIP Warehouses, Rooms, etc. can be tagged. This classification is useful when generating reports or in certain stock transactions.</p> <p>Address and contact  You can add Billing, Shipping, and other types of addresses for the Warehouse. You can also add a contact, this could be the Warehouse Manager for example.</p> <p>1.2 After Saving</p> <p>After saving a Warehouse, you'll see the following options:</p> <ul> <li>Stock Balance: This will open the Stock Balance report to display the quantity, valuation, balance, etc.</li> <li>General Ledger: This will open the General Ledger to display the accounting transactions.</li> <li>Non-Group to Group: If the Warehouse is a Non-Group Warehouse, i.e. cannot contain other Warehouses under it, this button will make this a Group Warehouse.</li> </ul> <p>2.

To do so, each Warehouse should be linked with an Account in the Chart of Accounts (the same name as the Warehouse itself). This account captures the monetary equivalent of the goods or materials stored in that specific warehouse.</p> <p>If you have a more detailed Warehouse Tree, most likely it's a good idea to link the sub-locations (room, row, shelf, etc.) to the account of the actual Warehouse (the root Warehouse of that Tree) as most scenarios do not require to account for value of stock items per Shelf or Bin. For example, if you have Warehouse A, and the room, rows are B, C, etc., then link B and C to the account of A.</p> <p><code>Tip: This software maintains stock balance for every distinct combination of Item and Warehouse.

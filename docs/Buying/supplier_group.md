# Supplier Group 

**Supplier Group is an aggregation of suppliers that are similar in some way.**

A supplier may be distinguished from a contractor or subcontractor, who commonly adds specialized input to deliverables. A supplier is also known as a vendor. There are different types of suppliers based on the goods and products they supply.

It allows you to create your own categories of suppliers. These categories are known as Supplier Groups. For example, if your suppliers are mainly pharmaceutical companies and FMCG distributors, you can create a new Supplier Groups for them and name the groups accordingly.

To access Supplier Group, go to:

`Home Buying > Supplier > Supplier Group`

**1. Prerequisites**

Before creating and using a Supplier Group, it is advised that you create the following first:

* <ins>[Supplier](../Buying/supplier.md)</ins>

**2. How to create a Supplier Group** 

1. Go to the Supplier Group list, click on New.
2. Type a name for your new Supplier Category.
3. You can set a Parent Supplier Group for this Supplier Group.
4. Ticking the Is Group checkbox will make it a Parent Supplier Group.
5. You can also assign a default Payment Terms Template to the Supplier Group. Useful in a case where all your hardware suppliers take half payment on sales order and half post shipment.
6. Save.

You can classify your suppliers from a range of choices available. Choose from a set of given options like Distributor, Electrical, Hardware, Local, Pharmaceutical, Raw Material, Services etc. Classifying your supplier into different types facilitates accounting and payments.

# Project Management

Project management is a structured approach to planning, executing, and monitoring projects to achieve specific goals efficiently. It involves defining project objectives, breaking them into tasks, assigning responsibilities, and tracking progress using tools like Gantt charts and Kanban boards. Effective project management ensures optimal resource allocation, time tracking, issue resolution, and cost control. Integration with other business processes, such as accounting and human resources, helps streamline operations. With real-time monitoring, collaboration tools, and automated workflows, project management enhances productivity, minimizes risks, and ensures successful project completion within scope, time, and budget constraints. 

**Why Use Software for Project Management?**

From the very beginning of your business, a key factor for success has been (and will continue to be) your company’s project management process. As your business grows, newer people, tasks, and teams are added, making it harder to track and manage projects efficiently. While collaboration still exists, the increasing complexity can lead to wasted resources and rising overhead costs. A well-structured project management system helps streamline processes, ensuring smooth operations and better resource utilization.

With the right tools, you can create, manage, and monitor every project from a single platform. It allows tracking of purchases and sales related to projects, helping manage budgets, deliveries, and profitability. Additionally, it can be used for managing internal projects, manufacturing jobs, or service-related tasks.

However, the success of project management depends entirely on the people involved. Simply implementing a system isn’t enough—teams must actively update and follow the workflow to keep projects running smoothly.

**Breaking Down the Workflow**

Most of the following terms are commonly used in project management. Let’s take a look at their role in a structured system.

 * <ins>[Project](project_management.md)</ins>

 * <ins>[Task](tasks.md)</ins>

 * <ins>[Timesheet](timesheets.md)</ins>

 * <ins>[Project Cost](costing.md)</ins>

 * <ins>[Inventory & Assets ](inventory.md)</ins>

**Setting Up a Workflow**

Once the project management system is in place, teams can begin organizing their work. For example, a fashion design team working on a summer collection would start by defining the project, setting priorities, and assigning tasks to different team members.

The main project is created, with details such as project name, status, type, progress, task lists, and assignments.
Tasks are assigned to employees across various departments, providing them with clear objectives, deadlines, and responsibilities. Expense claims related to tasks can also be recorded.
Employees track their time using timesheets, logging activities, time spent, and any billable tasks.
Project costs and profitability are consistently monitored, ensuring optimal resource utilization and financial efficiency.
By maintaining an organized and systematic workflow, businesses can manage projects more effectively, improve collaboration, and achieve better outcomes.

# Lead 

**A lead is a potential customer who might be interested in your products or services.**

To get the customer through the door, you may be doing all or any of the following:

* Listing your product on directories.
* Maintaining an updated and searchable website.
* Meeting people at trade events.
* Advertising your products or services.

When you send out the word that you are around and have something valuable to offer, people will come in to check out your products. These are your Leads.

They are called Leads because they may lead you to a sale. Sales executives usually work on leads by calling them, building a relationship and sending information about products or services. It is important to track all this conversation to enable another person who may have to follow-up on that contact. The new person is then able to know the history of that particular Lead.

To access the Lead list, go to:

`Home > CRM > Sales Pipeline > Lead`

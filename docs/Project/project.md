# Project 

**A Project is a planned piece of work that is designed to find information about something, to produce something new, or to improve something.**

In this software, project management is task-driven. You can create a Project and divide it into multiple Tasks.

A Project has a broad scope and hence can be divided into tasks. Think of coming up with a new smartphone for the next year as a Project. Then things like designing, prototyping, testing, delivery, etc. become tasks under the project.

Whilst each task within a Project can be assigned to an individual or a group of individuals, the assignment can also be done at the project level.

These Tasks can be created from a Project itself or a Task can be created separately as well.

To access Projects, go to:

`Home > Projects > Project`

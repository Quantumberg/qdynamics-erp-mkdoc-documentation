# Time Tracking 
Project time tracking plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate project management and resource utilisation.

By allowing employees to log time against specific tasks or projects, it provides a clear visibility to time spent on various activities. This feature helps in monitoring project progress, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing resource allocation.Time tracking in the project management modules allows project managers to make informed decisions based on real-time data, ultimately contributing to more efficient project execution and successful outcomes.

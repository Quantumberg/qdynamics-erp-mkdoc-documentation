# Maintenance of Assets

Maintaining assets involves a streamlined process of managing the lifecycle of valuable resources owned by a business. This includes creating asset records with details such as acquisition date, cost, location, and depreciation method.

This software facilitates regular maintenance scheduling based on predefined intervals or usage thresholds, ensuring assets are kept in optimal condition. Maintenance logs capture detailed information about maintenance activities, costs incurred, and personnel involved, providing a clear audit trail for the assets.

The system also enables efficient management of work orders for maintenance tasks, assigning responsibilities and tracking progress to ensure timely completion. The businesses can improve operational efficiency and have better asset maintenance plan for better optimisation of available resources.

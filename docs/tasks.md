# Task Management  

Projects are broken down into tasks, which are assigned to different team members. Some systems allow tasks to be created and assigned independently of a specific project. Tasks help in organizing work efficiently by setting priorities, deadlines, dependencies, and assignments to individuals or departments. They can also be linked to expense claims, ensuring that costs are recorded accurately.
 

### Features:  
- Assign tasks with priority levels  
- Set due dates and dependencies

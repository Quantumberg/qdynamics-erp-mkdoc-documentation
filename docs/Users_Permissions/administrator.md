# Administrator 

**The 'Administrator' is above the System Manager and has all the rights and permissions for an account.**

A System Manager also has permissions to most items in the system, but the Administrator has unrestricted access. The administrator ensures that the overall functioning of the this system meets the needs of the organisation.

If your account is cloud-hosted with us, then you won't be able to access your account as an Administrator.

For cloud-hosted accounts, upgrades are managed from the backend. We reserve admin login credentials with us so that we can upgrade all customer accounts from the backend.Since a single server may host multiple customer accounts, as a security measure, we cannot share the credentials for the administrator account with any cloud-hosted user. (An exception would be if you purchase a large number of users and your account is exclusively hosted on one server).For self-hosted on-premises accounts, the admin credentials are with the account user.

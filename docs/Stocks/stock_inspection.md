# Stock Inspection 
Quality inspection stock module involves assessing and ensuring the quality of incoming and outgoing inventory items.

When items are received into stock, quality inspectors can perform inspections based on predefined criteria such as physical condition, specifications, or regulatory standards. Inspection results can be recorded, and items can be accepted, rejected, or placed on hold based on the inspection outcome.

During outgoing transactions such as sales or transfers, quality inspections can be conducted to verify that items meet specified quality standards before being shipped or transferred.

It facilitates the creation of inspection criteria, inspection plans, and inspection certificates to streamline the quality control process.

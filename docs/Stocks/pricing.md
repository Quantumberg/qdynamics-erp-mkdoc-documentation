# Pricing

In the stock module , item pricing plays a vital role in managing the cost and selling price of items. Each item in the system can have a defined purchase price, which reflects the cost incurred to acquire the item. 
It allows businesses to set different pricing levels based on factors such as currency, customer groups, or pricing rules.

This flexibility enables businesses to implement diverse pricing strategies, such as volume discounts, promotional pricing, or tiered pricing based on customer relationships. Effective item pricing helps businesses maintain accurate cost calculations, optimize profit margins, and tailor pricing strategies to meet customer needs and market demands.

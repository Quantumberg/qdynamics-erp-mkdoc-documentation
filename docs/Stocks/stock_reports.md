# Stock Reports 
Stock reports provide valuable insights into the status and movements of inventory within an organization.

These reports typically include information such as current stock levels, stock transactions, stock valuations, stock aging, and item-wise details. Inventory managers can generate stock reports to track stock availability, identify trends in stock movements, monitor inventory turnover rates, and analyse stock-related costs.

# Rules 
Shipping and pricing rules are essential features in stock module that streamline the management of shipping costs and pricing strategies.

Shipping rules allow businesses to define various parameters for calculating shipping charges, such as weight, volume, destination, or shipping method. These rules automate the calculation of shipping costs during sales transactions, ensuring accurate and consistent shipping charges based on predefined criteria.

On the other hand, pricing rules empower businesses to create dynamic pricing strategies based on specific conditions or criteria. This includes setting discounts, promotions, bulk pricing, or special pricing for different customer segments, items, or sales channels.

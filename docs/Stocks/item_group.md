# Item Group

An Item Group is a way to classify items based on types.

Depending on the type of product, you can categorize an item under its respective field. If the product is service-oriented, assign it under the Item Group - service. If the product is used as a raw-material, assign it under the Raw Material category. In case, an item is used only in trading, you can categorize it under an Item Group called Trading.

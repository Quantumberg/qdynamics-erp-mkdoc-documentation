# Serial and Batch 
Serial and batch tracking are integral features for effectively managing inventory items with unique identifiers.

Serial tracking involves assigning a unique serial number to each individual item, enabling businesses to track its lifecycle from procurement to sale. This allows for precise traceability, warranty tracking, and identification of specific items in case of recalls or quality issues.

However, batch tracking involves grouping items with identical attributes, such as manufacturing date or lot number, into batches. This enables businesses to trace and manage batches of items as they move through the supply chain, ensuring compliance with regulations, managing expiry dates, and facilitating recalls if necessary.

Both serial and batch tracking functionalities provide businesses with granular control over inventory management, enhancing traceability, quality control, and compliance efforts.

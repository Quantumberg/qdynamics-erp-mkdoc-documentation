It involves defining project objectives, breaking them into tasks, assigning responsibilities, and tracking progress using tools like Gantt charts and Kanban boards. Effective project management ensures optimal resource allocation, time tracking, issue resolution, and cost control. Integration with other business processes, such as accounting and human resources, helps streamline operations. With real-time monitoring, collaboration tools, and automated workflows, project management enhances productivity, minimizes risks, and ensures successful project completion within scope, time, and budget constraints. </p> <p>Why Use Software for Project Management?</p> <p>From the very beginning of your business, a key factor for success has been (and will continue to be) your company\u2019s project management process. As your business grows, newer people, tasks, and teams are added, making it harder to track and manage projects efficiently. While collaboration still exists, the increasing complexity can lead to wasted resources and rising overhead costs. A well-structured project management system helps streamline processes, ensuring smooth operations and better resource utilization.</p> <p>With the right tools, you can create, manage, and monitor every project from a single platform. It allows tracking of purchases and sales related to projects, helping manage budgets, deliveries, and profitability. Additionally, it can be used for managing internal projects, manufacturing jobs, or service-related tasks.</p> <p>However, the success of project management depends entirely on the people involved. Simply implementing a system isn\u2019t enough\u2014teams must actively update and follow the workflow to keep projects running smoothly.</p> <p>Breaking Down the Workflow</p> <p>Most of the following terms are commonly used in project management.

For example, a fashion design team working on a summer collection would start by defining the project, setting priorities, and assigning tasks to different team members.</p> <p>The main project is created, with details such as project name, status, type, progress, task lists, and assignments. Tasks are assigned to employees across various departments, providing them with clear objectives, deadlines, and responsibilities. Expense claims related to tasks can also be recorded. Employees track their time using timesheets, logging activities, time spent, and any billable tasks. Project costs and profitability are consistently monitored, ensuring optimal resource utilization and financial efficiency. By maintaining an organized and systematic workflow, businesses can manage projects more effectively, improve collaboration, and achieve better outcomes.</p>"},{"location":"costing/","title":"Costing &amp; Profitability","text":"<p>Every project comes with associated costs, whether in terms of resources, time, or materials.

Generally, an asset is a tangible item that is located on the company premises or is carried by an employee. In some cases, an asset could be an intangible item.</p> <p>An asset's useful life spans across multiple years and hence its economic value is spread over corresponding years from the accounting perspective. If you buy a printer for $300 and it is expected to be useful for three years, from the accounting perspective $100 is recorded as the expense for three years each instead of all the $300 in the first year. Most countries have rules for such calculations.</p> <p>In this software, the Asset record is the heart of asset management module. All the transactions related to an Asset like purchasing, depreciation, maintenance, movement, scrapping, sales will be recorded against the Asset record.</p> <p>To access the Asset list, go to: &gt; Home &gt; Assets &gt; Assets &gt; Asset</p> <p>1. Prerequisites </p> <p>Before creating and using Asset, it is advised to create the following first:</p> <ul> <li>Item with 'Is Fixed Asset' enabled.</li> <li>Asset Category</li> </ul> <p>2. How to create an Asset</p> <p>An Item representing the asset should be created. The 'Maintain Stock' should be unchecked and 'Is Fixed Asset' must be checked.</p> <p>2.1 Auto creation of assets</p> <p>You can configure to automatically create assets on submission of Purchase Receipt by enabling 'Auto Create Assets on Purchase' in Item.</p> <p>If you have enabled auto asset creation for the item representing an asset, you will have to provide the asset location while submitting the Purchase Receipt.</p> <p>A message confirming the creation of assets is displayed on submission of Purchase Receipt.</p> <p>2.2 Manual creation of assets</p> <p>If you would like to create assets manually, create an Item with 'Is Fixed Asset' enabled and leave 'Auto Create Assets on Purchase' unchecked . On submission of a Purchase Receipt/Purchase Invoice with that Item a message is shown indicating that you need to create assets manually.</p> <p>Follow below steps to create assets manually.</p> <ol> <li>Go to the Assets list, click on New.</li> <li>Enter a name for the asset.</li> <li>Select the Item Code. Item Name and Asset Category will be fetched automatically.</li> <li>Select the Asset Owner, i.e. Company, Supplier, or Customer.</li> <li>Select the Company/Supplier/Customer.</li> <li>Select the Purchase Receipt/Purchase Invoice. Purchase Date and Gross Purchase Amount will be fetched automatically.</li> <li>Select a Location. Eg: Mumbai Office. This will be fetched automatically if specified in Purchase Receipt items table</li> <li>Set Available-for-use Date. The depreciation will be calculated starting from this date.</li> <li>Save and Submit.</li> </ol> <p>Please note you need create one asset record for each asset you have bought. If you have bought five computers and have created just one Purchase Receipt with quantity set to five then you will have to create five asset records manually.</p> <p>2.3 Creating composite assets</p> <p>If, for example, you want to create a \"Computer\" asset made from multiple different items like \"Monitor\", \"Keyboard\", etc., you can create a composite WIP asset by checking the is_composite_asset checkbox. Afterwards, you can tag that asset in the WIP Composite Asset field of the Item in Purchase Receipts/Invoices, and once all the items are available, you can use the Asset Capitalization feature to capitalize the asset.</p> <p>2.4 Importing existing assets</p> <p>When you move from a legacy system to software, you will have to add details of all the assets your company has purchased previously along with depreciation details of each asset.</p> <p>For an existing asset, you can create the asset record directly by checking \"Is Existing Asset\" checkbox and provide below details.</p> <ul> <li>Gross Purchase Amount</li> <li>Purchase Date</li> <li>Available-for-use Date</li> <li>Opening Accumulated Depreciation: The accumulated depreciation amount which has already been booked for an existing asset.</li> <li>Number of Depreciations Booked: Number of depreciation entries already booked.</li> <li>Is Fully Depreciated: Mark this checkbox if the existing asset is fully depreciated</li> </ul> <p>Based on these details the schedule for depreciation of remaining amount will be created automatically.</p> <p>2.5 Additional options when creating an Asset</p> <ul> <li>Custodian: The employee who will carry the asset.</li> <li>Department: The department of the Custodian.</li> <li>Calculate Depreciation: Enable this checkbox to calculate depreciation of Assets.</li> </ul> <p>3.

In case of existing assets which are partially depreciated, mention the number of pending depreciations. For example, if you set frequency as 12 months and no. of depreciations as 3, 1 depreciation will be booked every 12 months for 3 years.</li> <li>Depreciation Method: There are four available methods for depreciation: Straight Line, Written Down Value, Double Declining Balance and Manual. You can find more details here.</li> <li>Depreciation Posting Date: The date from which booking of depreciation will be started.</li> <li>Expected Value After Useful Life: Useful Life is the time period over in which the company expects that the asset will be productive. After that period, either the asset is scrapped or sold. In case it is sold, mention the estimated value here. This value is also known as Salvage Value, Scrap Value, or Residual Value.</li> <li>Salvage Value Percentage: If you want the Expected Value After Useful Life to be calculated automatically based on a percent of the Gross Purchase Amount, mention the percent here.</li> <li>Rate of Depreciation: This will be calculated based on the amount entered in expected value after useful life.</li> <li>Finance Book: The book against which the depreciation entries should be booked. For more details, click here.</li> <li>Depreciate based on daily pro-rata: This divides the depreciation amount by the number of days in a calendar period. For example, the depreciation amount in February is less than the depreciation amount for the months that have 31 days.</li> <li>Depreciate based on shifts: This lets you define the number of shifts the asset would run in a period in order to depreciate it accordingly. You need to first define the shift names with their shift factors in the Asset Shift Factor doctype (for example: \"half\": 0.5, \"single\": 1, \"double\": 1.5 and \"triple\": 2) and set a default. Later if you want to change the shifts of an asset for a particular period, you can do so using the Asset Shift Allocation doctype, and the remaining shifts are automatically adjusted.</li> </ol> <p>3.2 Depreciation Schedule</p> <p>On booking depreciations against this Asset, the Depreciation Schedule section will be visible. This table has columns for Finance Book, Schedule Date, Depreciation Amount, Amount Depreciated, and Journal Entry.</p> <p>3.3 Insurance Details</p> <p>If Insurance has been taken for the Asset you're recording, you can store the following Insurance details:</p> <ul> <li>Policy number</li> <li>Insurer</li> <li>Insured value</li> <li>Insurance Start Date</li> <li>Insurance End Date</li> <li>Comprehensive Insurance</li> </ul> <p>3.4 Accounting Entries</p> <p>On submission of an asset, \"Capital Work in Progress\" account will be credited and the asset account related to the asset will be debited.

This method is useful when the asset depreciates fast in the beginning and slows down later.</p> <p>Example: If the asset is worth 100,000 and its salvage value is 11,000 after 8 years, the depreciation schedule would be:</p> <p>Written Down Value</p> <p>In this method, you can set a particular rate of depreciation or let the system calculate the rate of depreciation based on the asset\u2019s purchase amount, salvage value, and useful life. The rate of depreciation is applied to the current written down value of the asset to calculate the depreciation amount for each year. This method is useful for assets that have higher depreciation in the initial years.</p> <p>Example: If the asset\u2019s purchase amount is 1,000 and the rate of depreciation is 40% over 5 years, the depreciation schedule would be:</p> <p>Manual</p> <p>In this method, a system-generated depreciation schedule is created for your convenience based on the depreciation details set.

More</p> <p>4.1 Accounting Impact </p> <p>Similar to a Sales Invoice, in a Purchase Invoice you have to enter an Expense or an Asset account for each row in your Items table. This helps to indicate if the Item is an Asset or an Expense. You can also change the Cost Center. These can also be set in the Item master. The Cost Center can be set at the Company level.</p> <p>The Purchase Invoice will affect your accounts as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a typical double entry \u201cpurchase\u201d:</li> <li> <p>Debits:</p> <ul> <li>Expense or Asset (net totals, excluding taxes)</li> <li>Taxes (/assets if VAT-type or expense again)</li> <li> <p>Credits:</p> </li> <li> <p>Supplier</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>4.2 Accounting When Is Paid is checked </p> <p>If Is Paid is checked, It will also make the following accounting entries:</p> <p>Debits:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Supplier Credits:</p> </li> <li> <p>Bank/Cash </p> </li> </ul> <p>To see entries in your Purchase Invoice after you \u201cSubmit\u201d, click on \u201cView Ledger\u201d.</p> <p>4.3 Is purchase an \u201cExpense\u201d or an \u201cAsset\u201d?</p> <p>If the Item is consumed immediately on purchase, or if it is a service, then the purchase becomes an \u201cExpense\u201d. For example, a telephone bill or travel bill is an \u201cExpense\u201d - it is already consumed.</p> <p>For inventory Items, that have a value, these purchases are not yet \u201cExpense\u201d, because they still have a value while they remain in your stock. They are \u201cAssets\u201d. If they are raw-materials (used in a process), they will become \u201cExpense\u201d the moment they are consumed in the process. If they are to be sold to a Customer, they become \u201cExpense\u201d when you ship them to the Customer.</p> <p>4.4 Deducting Taxes at Source</p> <p>In many countries, the law may require you to deduct taxes, while paying your suppliers. These taxes could be based on a standard rate. Under these type of schemes, typically if a Supplier crosses a certain threshold of payment, and if the type of product is taxable, you may have to deduct some tax (which you pay back to your government, on your Supplier\u2019s behalf).</p> <p>To do this, you will have to make a new Tax Account under \u201cTax Liabilities\u201d or similar and credit this Account by the percent you are bound to deduct for every transaction.</p> <p>4.5 Hold Payments For A Purchase Invoice </p> <p>There are two ways to put a purchase invoice on hold:</p> <ul> <li>Date Span Hold</li> <li>Explicit Hold</li> </ul> <p>Explicit Hold  Explicit hold holds the purchase invoice indefinitely. To do it, in the \"Hold Invoice\" section of the purchase invoice form, simply check the \"Hold Invoice\" checkbox. In the \"Reason For Putting On Hold\" text field, type a comment explaining why the invoice is to be put on hold.</p> <p>If you need to hold a submitted invoice, click the \"Make\" button and click \"Block Invoice\". Also, add a comment explaining why the invoice is to be put on hold in the dialog that pops up and click \"Save\".</p> <p>Date Span Hold</p> <p>Date span hold holds the purchase invoice until a specified date. To do it, in the \"Hold Invoice\" section of the purchase invoice form, check the \"Hold Invoice\" checkbox. Next, input the release date in the dialog that pops up and click \"Save\". The release date is the date that the hold on the document expires.</p> <p>After the invoice has been saved, you can change the release date by clicking on the \"Hold Invoice\" drop-down button and then \"Change Release Date\". This action will cause a dialog to appear.</p> <p>Select the new release date and click \"Save\". You should also enter a comment in the \"Reason For Putting On Hold\" field.</p> <p>Take note of the following:</p> <ul> <li>All purchases that have been placed on hold will not be included in a Payment Entry's references table</li> <li>The release date cannot be in the past.</li> <li>You can only block or unblock a purchase invoice if it is unpaid.</li> <li>You can only change the release date if the invoice is unpaid.</li> </ul> <p>4.6 Provisional accounting for expenses (only for Non-Stock Items)</p> <p>In many situations, a service is received and the expense is incurred but the Purchase Invoicing for that service is done in the subsequent month, so this expense doesn't flow into your monthly financial statements like Profit and Loss as invoicing is still pending. Provisional Accounting helps you address this problem. Below are the steps to set up provisional accounting.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Enable provisional accounting in the company master and set the default provisional account</p> </li> <li> <p>Make a Purchase Receipt for a non-stock item</p> </li> <li> <p>Accounting entries against the Purchase Receipt will be as follows</p> </li> </ol> <p>Make a Purchase Invoice against the Purchase Receipt Accounting entries against the Purchase Invoice will be posted as usual</p> <p>On posting a purchase invoice accounting entries against the purchase receipt will be reversed</p>"},{"location":"Buying/purchase_order/","title":"Purchase Order","text":"<p>A Purchase Order is a binding contract with your Supplier that you promise to buy a set of items under given conditions.</p> <p>It is similar to a Sales Order but instead of sending it to an external party, you keep it for internal records.</p> <p><code>Home &gt; Buying &gt; Purchasing &gt; Purchase Order</code></p> <p>1.

Formulas can use the following mathematical functions:</p> <ul> <li>addition: +</li> <li>subtraction: -</li> <li>multiplication: *</li> <li>division: /</li> <li>min: min(x,y)</li> <li>max: max(x,y)</li> <li>if/else: (x) if (formula) else (y)</li> <li>less than: &lt;</li> <li>greater than: &gt;</li> <li>variables: {variable_name}</li> </ul> <p>It is crucial that the formula be solvable for all variable values. This is most often an issue if the value resolves to 0. For example:</p> <p><code>{total_accepted_items} / {total_received_items}</code></p> <p>This example would resolve to 0 / 0 in periods where there are no received items, and therefore should have a check to protect in this case:</p> <p><code>({total_accepted_items} / {total_received_items}) if {total_received_items} &gt; 0 else 1.</code></p> <p>2.5 Evaluating the Supplier</p> <p>An evaluation is generated for each Supplier Scorecard Period by clicking the \"Generate Missing Scorecard Periods\" button.

But assume 500 people are working in the company out of which only 100 use all documents and the remaining 400 need only documents for daily attendance or leave applications. Such users are limited users.</p> <p>The User Type document plays an important role to handle this use case. There are default User Types, \"System User\" and \"Website User\". The System User can access the desk and website portal whereas the Website User can only access the website portal. To handle the case of limited access of documents for the employees by default it has added a new user type 'Employee Self Service'.</p> <p>User Type</p> <p>To access the User Type document, go to:</p> <p><code>Users &gt; User Type</code></p> <p><code>Note: Website User and System User will be standard user types and these cannot be deleted or edited</code></p> <p>Non-Standard User Type </p> <p>1) For the non standard user type, user has to select the Custom Role, document on which they want to apply the user permission, and the fieldname of the user.</p> <p>In the above image, Employee has the link field User ID which is linked to the User document. As the \"Apply User Permission on\" has been set as \"Employee\", then the respective employee's user can only view the documents in which the respective employee field is linked. For example, the employee can only able to view the salary slip which has been created against their employee id.</p> <p>2) Document Types:</p> <p>The non-standard user type users can only access the documents which have been mentioned in the user type.</p> <p>It also acts as the Role Permission Manager for this particular User Type (Employee Self Service in our case). Employee Self Service as a role won't be accessible in the general Role Permission Manager.</p> <p>3) Document Types (Select Permissions Only):</p> <p>In this table, you need to list down all the doctypes that you want the Employee Self Service User to have SELECT access to. There is no limit to the number of doctypes you can add here. Users will not be able to create the records for the documents to which they have Select perm access.</p>"},{"location":"Users_Permissions/managing_perm_level/","title":"Managing Perm Level in Permission Manager","text":"<p>Perm Level is way of reducing the amount information visible or changeable in a specific DocType for certain User Groups. Where as you can define visibility or changability for each DocType by customizing the DocType-specific Permissions Rule, with the Perm Level you can change these for specific Sections or Fields.</p> <p>In each document, you can group fields by \"levels\".

Hence, you can set any perm level for an item, and then do permission setting for it.</p> <p>If you want to change permissions for all fields in a section, you can simply change the perm level for the section field and it will be applied to all fields in the section.</p>"},{"location":"Users_Permissions/permissions/","title":"Permissions","text":"<p>Permissions refer to the access rights granted to users or roles within the system.

The permission structure allows you to define different permission rules for different fields using a concept called Permission Level of a field.</p> <p>1. How to use the Role Permissions Manager </p> <p>To start using the Role Permission Manager, go to:</p> <p><code>Home &gt; Users and Permissions &gt; Role Permissions Manager</code></p> <p></p> <p>Permissions are applied on a combination of:</p> <ul> <li>Roles: As we saw earlier, Users are assigned Roles and it is on these Roles that permission rules are applied. For example, a sales user may be given the roles of an Employee and a Sales User.</li> </ul> <p>Examples of Roles include Accounts Manager, Employee, HR User, etc.</p> <ul> <li>Document Types: Each type of document, master or transaction, has a separate list of role-based permissions as seen in the preceding screenshot.</li> </ul> <p>Examples of Document Types are Sales Invoice, Leave Application, Stock Entry, etc.</p> <ul> <li>Permission Levels: In each document, you can group fields by \"levels\". Each group of fields is denoted by a unique number (0 to 9). A separate set of permission rules can be applied to each field group. By default, all fields are of level 0.</li> </ul> <p>Permission \"Level\" connects fields with level X to a permission rule with level X. To know more click here.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Document Stages: Permissions are applied on each stage of the document like Creation, Saving, Submission, Cancellation, and Amendment. A role can be permitted to Print, Email, Import or Export data, access Reports, or define User Permissions.</p> </li> <li> <p>User Permissions: Using User Permissions, a user can be restricted to access only specific Documents for that Document Type. Eg: Only one Territory from all Territories. User Permissions defined for other Document Types also get applied if they are related to the current Document Type through Link Fields.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, a Customer is a link field in a Sales Order or Quotation. In the Role Permissions Manager, User Permissions can be set using the 'Set User Permissions' button.</p> <p>To set User Permissions based on documents/fields go to:</p> <p><code>Home &gt; Users and Permissions &gt; Permissions &gt; User Permissions</code></p> <ul> <li>Add a New Rule: In the Role Permissions Manager, to add a new rule, click on the Add a New Rule button and a pop-up box will ask you to select a Role and a Permission Level.

For this, Employee Role should be given Read, Write, Create permissions.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>An Employee should only be able to access his/her Leave Application. Hence, User Permissions record should be created for each User-Employee combination.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>If you want an Employee to only select a document in another document and not have read access to that document as a whole, then grant only Select perm to the role, Employee.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>HR Manager should be able to see all Leave Applications. Create a Permission Rule for HR Manager at Level 0, with Read permissions. Apply User Permissions should be disabled.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Leave Approver should be able to see and update Leave Applications of employees under him/her. Leave Approver is given Read and Write access at Level 0. Relevant Employee Documents should be enlisted in the User Permissions of Leave Approvers. (This effort is reduced for Leave Approvers mentioned in Employee Documents, by programmatically creating User Permission records).</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>It should be Approved/Rejected only by HR User or Leave Approver. The Status field of a Leave Application is set at Level 1. HR User and Leave Approver are given Read and Write permissions for Level 0, while everyone else (All) are given Read permission for Level 1.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>HR User should be able to delegate Leave Applications to his/her subordinates. HR User is given the right to Set User Permissions. A User with HR User role would be able to define User Permissions on Leave Application for other users.</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"Users_Permissions/role_roleProfile/","title":"Role and Role Profile","text":"<p>A Role defines the permissions for accessing various documents</p> <p>Roles define a set of permissions which can be set from the Roles Permission Manager. Most commonly used roles are already defined in software, you can use the system with them. If needed, you can add more roles. For example, if you assign the Sales User role to a user, they'll be able to access documents like Quotations and Sales Orders since the permissions are already set for the role Sales User.</p> <p>Role profiles store different roles so that multiple roles can be assigned at once.</p> <p>Role Profiles act as a template to store and select multiple roles. This Role Profile can then be assigned to a User. For example, a Sales Supervisor will have the roles Employee, Sales Manager, Sales User, and Sales Master Manager.
